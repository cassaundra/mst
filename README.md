## Minimum spanning tree algorithms

[Prim's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) and [Kruskal's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) minimum spanning tree algorithms implemented in Haskell as part of CS 350 at PSU.

This is basically a rough draft since I was on a time crunch when I wrote it, but I hope to revisit it at a later point.
Almost certainly some optimizations that can be made.
I also wrote a few benchmarks and tests that I will add once they've been cleaned up.
